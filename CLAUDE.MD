Guidelines for aiding with development

# Claude Instructions for WD1770-SD Project

## Project Overview
This is a ZX Spectrum hardware interface add-on card for a Timex FDD system.
The goal is to replace and improve existing select logic, from two GAL and one JK flip-flop with a xilinx cpld

## Critical Rules

## When Starting New Conversation
1. Always check out a fresh new copy from the repo
2. Don't assume old artifacts are current
3. Always work from latest code user provides

User Preferences

- Direct, no-nonsense communication
- Focus on CODE only unless explicitly asked about documentation
- When user says "fix it" - actually fix it, don't just claim to
- Verify changes were actually applied
- User will explicitly request README updates

Communication Style

- Be direct and concise
- Don't apologize excessively
- When wrong, acknowledge and fix immediately
- Don't use phrases like "let me check" - just check
- Focus on solutions, not explanations of why things broke
